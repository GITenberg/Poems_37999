<p class="center"><span class="huge">INTRODUCTION</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="giant">A</span><span class="smcap">rthur Macy</span> was a Nantucket boy of Quaker extraction. His name alone is
evidence of this, for it is safe to say that a Macy, wherever found in
the United States, is descended from that sturdy old Quaker who was one
of those who bought Nantucket from the Indians, paid them fairly for it,
treated them with justice, and lived on friendly terms with them. In
many ways Arthur Macy showed that he was a Nantucketer and, at least by
descent, a Quaker. He often used phrases peculiar to our island in the
sea, and was given, in conversation at least, to similes which smacked
of salt water. Almost the last time I saw him he said, "I'm coming round
soon for a good long gam."</p>

<p>He was a many-sided man. In his intercourse with a friend like myself he
would show the side which he thought would interest me, and that only.
He was above all things cheery, and, to his praise be it said, he hated
a bore. I remember that a mutual friend was talking baseball to me by
the yard. Arthur was sitting by, listening. It was a subject in which he
was much interested. Nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span> turning to our mutual friend, he
said, "Don't talk baseball to <i>him</i>. He don't care anything about it, he
don't know anything about it, and he don't want to." On the other hand,
although little given to telling of his war experiences, he was always
ready to talk over the old days with me. Of what he did himself, he
modestly said but little, but of the services of others, more especially
of the men in the ranks, he was generous in his praise.</p>

<p>Early in the war Macy enlisted in Company B, 24th Michigan Volunteer
Infantry. He was twice wounded on the first day at Gettysburg, and
managed to crawl into the town and get as far as the steps of the Court
House, which was fast filling with wounded from both sides. His sense of
humor was in evidence even at such a time. A Confederate officer rode up
and asked, "Have those men in there got arms?" Quick as a flash Macy
answered: "Some of them have and some of them haven't." He remained in
this Court-House hospital, a prisoner within the Confederate lines,
until the battle was over and Lee's army retreated. All wounded
prisoners who could walk were forced to go with them, but Macy's wound
was in the foot, and, fortunately for him, he was spared the horrors of
a Southern prison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>He was on duty later at the Naval Academy Hospital in Annapolis,
presided over by Dr. Vanderkieft, perhaps as efficient a general
hospital administrator as the army had. I knew Dr. Vanderkieft very
well, and was on duty at his hospital when the exchanged prisoners came
back from Andersonville. Although Macy and I never met there, it came
out in our talk that we were there at the same time. He served his full
three years, and was honorably discharged about the close of the war.</p>

<p>It is given to but few to have the keen sense of humor which he
possessed. Quick and keen at repartee, he never practised it save when
worth while. He never said the clearly obvious thing. Failing something
better than that, he held his peace.</p>

<p>Had it not been for his disinclination to publish his verses, he long
ago would have had a national reputation. His reason for this
disinclination, as I gathered from many talks with him, was that he did
not consider his work of sufficiently high <i>poetic</i> standard. Every one
praised his choice of words, his wonderful facility in rhyme, the
perfection of his metre, and the daintiness and delicacy of his verse.
"All right," he would say, "but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span> is not Poetry with a big P, and
that is the only kind that should be published. And there is mighty
little of it." It is fortunate that this severe judgment, creditable as
it was to him, is not to prevail. Lovers of the beautiful are not to be
robbed of "Sit Closer, Friends," nor of "A Poet's Lesson," and many who
never heard of that remarkable Spanish pachyderm will take delight in
the story of "The Rollicking Mastodon," whose home was "in the trunk of
a Tranquil Tree." The greater part of his verses with which I am
familiar I heard at Papyrus Club dinners. He was an early member, and
one of the most esteemed. He was fairly sure to have something in his
pocket, and the presiding officer never called upon him in vain.</p>

<p>It was so at the Saint Botolph Club, of which he was long a member.
Whenever there was an "occasion" when the need of verse seemed
indicated, Arthur Macy could be counted on. His "Saint Botolph," which
has become the Club song, and will be sung as long as the Club endures,
was written for a Twelfth Night revel at my request. It has a peculiarly
old English flavor. He makes of the Saint, not the jolly friar nor yet
the severe recluse, but just a good, kind old man who "was loved by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span> the
sinners and loved by the good," one who was certain that there must be
sin so long as</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" summary="table">

<tr><td>"A few get the loaves and many get the crumbs,<br />
And some are born fingers and some are born thumbs."</td></tr></table>

<p>And here we get a glimpse of Arthur Macy's view of life, which was
certainly broad and generous, with a philosophic flavor.</p>

<p>Arthur Macy had a business side of which his Club intimates had but
slight knowledge. He represented, in New England, one of the great
commercial agencies of the country. His knowledge of business men, of
their standing, commercially and financially, was extended and intimate,
and was relied upon by our merchants and others as a basis for giving
credit. His office work required the closest attention to details and
the exercise of the most careful judgment. The whole success of such a
company as that which he represented depends upon the reliability of the
information which it gives. Without this it has no reason for existence.
It was to Arthur Macy that the merchants of Boston largely turned for
information concerning their customers scattered throughout New England,
and it was because of his success in obtaining such information and his
thorough knowledge of the business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span> in all its details that the superior
officers of the company placed such implicit confidence in his judgment
and so high a value upon his advice. And in the conduct of this business
he showed his Quaker straightforwardness. His work was not at all of the
"detective" sort. If information was wanted concerning a man's business
by those who had dealings with him, Macy went directly to the man
himself, and told him that it was for his own best interest to show just
where he stood, and, above all things, to tell the exact truth. Honest
men had the truth told about them, and profited by it. Dishonest men and
secretive men were passed over in severe silence, and their credit
suffered accordingly. Few of those who sought Arthur Macy for business
information ever suspected that they were talking to a poet and man of
letters.</p>

<p>I have not sought to tell Arthur Macy's life story. Neither have I
entered upon any detailed consideration of his verse. It is for the
reader to peruse the pages that follow and draw his own conclusion. I
have merely tried to give a glimpse of the characteristics of one of the
most charming personalities I ever knew.</p>

<span class="giant">T</span><small>IME</small> and I have fallen out;<br />
We, who were such steadfast friends.<br />
So slowly has it come about<br />
That none may tell when it began;<br />
Yet sure am I a cunning plan<br />
Runs through it all;<br />
And now, beyond recall,<br />
Our friendship ends,<br />
And ending, there remains to me<br />
The memory of disloyalty.<br />
<br />
Long years ago Time tripping came<br />
With promise grand,<br />
And sweet assurances of fame;<br />
And hand in hand<br />
Through fairy-land<br />
Went he and I together<br />
In bright and golden weather.<br />
Then, then I had not learned to doubt,<br />
For friends were gods, and faith was sure,<br />
And words were truth, and deeds were pure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span><br />
Before we had our falling out;<br />
And life, all hope, was fair to see,<br />
When Time made promise sweet to me.<br />
<br />
When first my faithless friend grew cold<br />
I sought to knit a closer bond,<br />
But he, less fond,<br />
Sad days and years upon me rolled,<br />
Pressed me with care,<br />
With envy tinged the boyhood hair,<br />
And ploughed unwelcome furrows in<br />
Where none had been.<br />
In vain I begged with trembling lip<br />
For our old sweet companionship,<br />
And saw, 'mid prayers and tears devout,<br />
The presage of our falling out.<br />
<br />
And now I know Time has no friends,<br />
Nor pity lends,<br />
But touches all<br />
With heavy finger soon or late;<br />
And as we wait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span><br />
The Reaper's call,<br />
The sickle's fatal sweep,<br />
We strive in vain to keep<br />
One truth inviolate,<br />
One cherished fancy free from doubt.<br />
It was not so<br />
Long years ago,<br />
Before we had our falling out.<br />
<br />
If Time would come again to me,<br />
And once more take me by the hand<br />
For golden walks through fairy-land,<br />
I could forgive the treachery<br />
That stole my youth<br />
And what of truth<br />
Was mine to know;<br />
Nor would I more his love misdoubt;<br />
And I would throw<br />
My arms around him so,<br />
That he'd forgive the falling out!</td></tr></table>

You take a cloud of a silvern hue,<br />

With a cadence caught from a dulcet air,<br />
A tale of love and a lock of hair,<br />

<br />
Or, delving deep in a mine unwrought,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You find in the teeming earth</span><br />
The golden vein of a noble thought;<br />
The soul of a statesman still unbought,<br />

Had daily knelt at Cogswell's fount divine,<br />

Proud, in a sack coat and a high silk hat,<br />

A nameless horror met his modest eyes;<br />
For where the artist's chisel had engrossed<br />
An emblem fit on Boston's proudest boast,<br />
There stood aloft, with graceful equipoise,<br />
Two very small, unexpurgated boys.<br />
Filled with solicitude for city youth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span><br />
Whose morals suffer when they're told the truth,<br />
Whose ethic standards high and higher rise,<br />
When taught that God and nature are but lies,<br />
In haste he to the council chamber hied,<br />
His startled fellow-members called aside,<br />
His fearful secret whispering disclosed,<br />
Till all their separate joints were ankylosed.<br />
Appalling was the silence at his tale;<br />
Democrats turned red, Republicans turned pale.<br />
What mugwumps turned 'tis difficult to think,<br />
But probably they compromised on pink.<br />
<br />
When these stern moralists had their breaths regained,<br />
And told how deeply they were shocked and pained,<br />
They then resolved how wrong our children are,<br />
Said, "Boys should be contented with a scar,"<br />
Rebuked Dame Nature for her deadly sins,<br />
And damned trustees who foster "Heavenly Twins."<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The world had ever heard;</span><br />
And clear, melodious, and strong,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And sweet was every word.</span><br />
The flowing numbers came to me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Unbidden from the heart;</span><br />
So pure the strain, that poesy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Seemed something more than art.</span><br />
<br />
No doubtful cadence marred a line,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So tunefully it flowed,</span><br />
And through the measure, all divine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The fire of genius glowed.</span><br />
So deftly were the verses wrought,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So fair the legend told,</span><br />
That every word revealed a thought,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And every thought was gold.</span><br />
<br />
Mine was the charm, the power, the skill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The wisdom of the years;</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To laughter or to tears.</span><br />
For subtile pleasantry was there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And brilliant flash of wit;</span><br />
Now, pleading eyes were raised in prayer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And now with smiles were lit.</span><br />
<br />
I sang of hours when youth was king,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And of one happy spot</span><br />
Where life and love were everything,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And time was half forgot.</span><br />
Of gracious days in woodland ways,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When every flower and tree</span><br />
Seemed echoing the sweetest phrase<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From lips in Arcadie.</span><br />
<br />
Of sagas old and Norseman bands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That sailed o'er northern seas;</span><br />
Enchanting tales of fairy lands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And strange philosophies.</span><br />
I sang of Egypt's fairest queen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With passion's fatal curse;</span><br />
Of that pale, sad-faced Florentine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As deathless as his verse.</span><br />
<br />
Of time of the Arcadian Pan,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When dryads thronged the trees&mdash;</span><br />
When Atalanta swiftly ran<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With fleet Hippomenes.</span><br />
Brave stories, too, did I relate<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of battle-flags unfurled;</span><br />
Of glorious days when Greece was great&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When Rome was all the world!</span><br />
<br />
Of noble deeds for noble creeds,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of woman's sacrifice&mdash;</span><br />
The mother's stricken heart that bleeds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For souls in Paradise.</span><br />
Anon I told a tale of shame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And while in tears I slept,</span><br />
Behold! a white-robed angel came<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And read the words and wept!</span><br />
<br />
And so I wrote my perfect song,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In such a wondrous key,</span><br />
I heard the plaudits of the throng,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And fame awaited me.</span><br />
Alas! the sullen morning broke,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And came the tempest's roar:</span><br />
'Mid discord trembling I awoke,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And lo! my dream was o'er!</span><br />
<br />
Yet often in the quiet night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My song returns to me;</span><br />
I seize the pen, and fain would write<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My long lost melody.</span><br />
But dreaming o'er the words, ere long<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Comes vague remembering,</span><br />
And fades away the sweetest song<br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
